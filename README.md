## External contributions

If you want to add new widgets or extensions, please keep in mind before submitting a PR :

- Widgets and extensions must be generic enough to be usable in many projects
- Unit tests and automated tests are mandatory. 100% coverage is required for any newly added code

Thanks for your contributions!

Happy Coding.
